# Watch Store App

Welcome to the Watch Store App - a premier destination for exploring and purchasing luxury watches. Built with Flutter, this application adheres to the best practices for code organization and design patterns, offering a clean, scalable, and user-friendly shopping experience.

## Application Structure

The Watch Store App follows Flutter's recommended project structure, ensuring that all components are modular and reusable. We've organized the codebase into clear directories for models, views, widgets, and services to facilitate easy navigation and maintenance.

## Clean Code

Our commitment to clean code is evident throughout the application. We use meaningful naming conventions, follow Dart's style guide, and write scalable functions. This approach enhances readability and simplifies future development efforts.

## Applying Concepts

The app demonstrates efficient algorithms and employs Flutter's design patterns to create a robust and responsive user interface. Performance and user experience are our top priorities, and we've optimized the app to reflect that.

## Global Variable Management

We utilize a global management system to handle the state of the watch items efficiently. A centralized global List variable ensures that the state is maintained and accessible throughout the app, leading to a seamless user experience.

## Data Representation

Each watch item is represented as an object using a well-defined model class. This class includes attributes such as name, brand, price, and quantity, allowing for detailed and structured data representation.

## User Interactions

The app allows for a variety of user interactions:

- **Add**: Users can add new watches to their shopping list with all necessary details.
- **View**: A user-friendly display showcases the selected watches with their details.
- **Update**: Users have the flexibility to modify the details of the watches in their shopping list.
- **Remove**: Items can be easily removed from the shopping list if desired.
